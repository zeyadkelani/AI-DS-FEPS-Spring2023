## P420 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in Empirical Political Science

<br/>
This course is designed to introduce the intersection of machine learning, data science, and political science. Through a combination of theoretical and practical instruction, you will understand how these fields can be used to analyze and interpret political phenomena. Topics covered will include:
<br/>

* An introduction to machine learning and data science concepts and techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, and evaluation methods <br/>

* Applications of machine learning in political science, such as text analysis social media data, network analysis of political campaigns, and prediction of political outcomes <br/>

* The use of data visualization and communication techniques to effectively present findings and insights<br/>

* Hands-on experience using popular machine learning and data science tools such as Python, through problem sets and projects. <br/>

* Analysis of real-world political data sets and research questions, to understand how these tools can be used to inform decisions and inform political science research.
